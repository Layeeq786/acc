					Why do you use codenames instead of "real names" for the character articles?
				</span> 
				<i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i> 
			</header> 
			<p class="description"> 
				We at the Marvel Cinematic Universe Wiki strive to be an objective encyclopedia, by collecting and assessing primarily, the information provided by Marvel themselves. Starting with the use of codenames for the names of movies and television series, and the quotes in-universe from jokes "There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?" to the very iconic "I am Iron Man", it is very clear that the Marvel Cinematic Universe fully embraces the use of codenames.

More definitely, Marvel's own encyclopedia, the Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, fully uses codenames for the titles of their character articles, so this, and this alone, would be enough to be our reason for using this system. For instance, both Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War entries had an article with the name Scarlet Witch for Wanda Maximoff, and we follow suit with what Marvel lays out.

Add to that the fact explained in the Naming Policy, that given these characters are more widely known to the general public for their codenames than their civilian names, it helps improve the wiki's traffic through the use of internet search engines. Judging by the, literally, more than a hundred thousand views top pages receive upon the release of new content, it is clear that this system works.

					When will an article for the alternate timeline [character] be created?
				</span> 
				<i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i> 
			</header> 
			<p class="description"> 
				Despite the layout for the creation of alternate characters is already drafted in the Naming Policy, following the release of Avengers: Endgame, a lot of alternate versions of characters were introduced, without fleshing out the nature of the alternate universe they hail from.

On the other hand, Marvel Television, who has also introduced alternate versions of characters, has ended their series, so we have all the information that is going to be available for the foreseeable future in order to determine the nature of the universes seen in their series.

This is the reason alternate characters for some TV series already exist while the creation for ones from the movies are put on hold. Exceptions may arise with the creation of Temporary Unnamed Reality Designations for characters, in order to help the edition and keeping them separate from the main counterpart of the character, but they are decided and created on a case by case basis.

					Why don't you rename [this article]?
				</span> 
				<i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i> 
			</header> 
			<p class="description"> 
				The most common reason for not renaming an article is, obviously, because the current name already follows the Naming Policy.

If it doesn't follow it, another common reason is that we are waiting until ongoing content (a particular TV series season, usually) wraps up to have the full picture and know as much as we can to make the better decission regarding the subject, what we call Editing Moratoriums. Impatience and making rushed decisions are never a good idea.

Also, keep in mind that renaming an article is not immediate. Potentially, changing a name may affect the links and text in thousands of articles, so we just ask for your patience and cooperation.

If you want to propose a rename for an article to better fit the current policy, and there is not a moratorium on it, you can make a formal proposal in said article's talk page.
